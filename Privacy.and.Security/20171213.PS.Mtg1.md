# Privacy and Security Working Group
## Meeting #1 - December 13, 2017

### Agenda
1. Introductions (Name, Occupation, What drew you to privacy and security) - 10 mins
2. Working Group Review (from [working group details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14f7bxky2UgOXEmK8TH8TuRgZhXwGdTupQ-kNuPyACn8/edit#gid=610158964) - 30 mins

  * Objectives - *Is any clarification/editing needed on these items? Is anything missing? Are there any subthemes that should be added?*
  
    * Preserving anonymity of individuals (Potentially change this to "individual control over identifiability" and add a more nuanced reference to 'preserving anonymity of individuals' as a sub-bullet)
    * Reducing risk to data subjects in case of breach
    * Engaging in overall safe and ethical practices surrounding the collection, storage, and distribution of data
    * Sharing collected data while avoiding the risk of abuse
    
  * Questions - *Is any clarification/editing needed on these questions? Are there any questions you would add? Are there any initial reactions / thoughts on items that should be included in the code of ethics?*
    * “What conditions should be placed on the collection, storage, and distribution of data, in order to make it safe and ethical?”
    * “To what extent do data scientists have a responsibility to ensure that the data they work with is collected, stored, and distributed in a safe and ethical way? What can data scientists commit to doing, in order to promote this?”
    * “How should data scientists balance the priorities of sharing collected data and avoiding the risk of that data being abused?”
    * "Should there be technical or qualitative 'threshold’ to consider when balancing the tradeoff between open data and privacy?"
    * "How do you ensure that once government or private de-identified open data is shared, that matching/joining against other data sets will not lead to re-identification?"

3. Research to Date - 10 mins

   * Summary of [Lit Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XwXmfIkQxXPidDT7domqEOC7KLcBVLAmSP_7V3g47j8/edit#heading=h.loopha52gwzl) so far from [Kickoff mtg](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FBO6XK6cQU5D3od8rXrCQVtXqLeMVUTQMUgPu169Cek/edit#heading=h.1h4g8q8x5ygr)

     * Respecting privacy of research subjects
     * Respecting confidentiality of collected information
     * Ensuring security (have security measures in place, how long are data stored…
     * Considering sensitivity (aggregation, etc.)
     * Considering identifiability
     * Considering intrusiveness in taking action (if govt agency comes up with findings, who should take action on those findings? That agency?)

   * Are there any privacy and security - related sources we are missing from the [Lit Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XwXmfIkQxXPidDT7domqEOC7KLcBVLAmSP_7V3g47j8/edit#heading=h.loopha52gwzl) / [Github](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/ethics-resources/blob/master/resources.md)?
     * Pew Research Center: "Americans and Cybersecurity": http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/01/26/americans-and-cybersecurity/
     * "Privacy and Information Sharing": http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/01/14/privacy-and-information-sharing/
     * Recent piece of research where they surveyed 100 people via Mechanical Turk about their privacy needs: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/UBP.avanance.pdf

4. Next Steps - 5 mins
   * Next mtg slated for the week of Dec 25-31
     * Any time zone restrictions
   * Reiterate action items for next mtg

### Notes

* Individual consent is both a challenge and an enabler of privacy
  * The individual feels missing from the objectives
  * Add individual rights and responsibilities
* “Anonymity” is a fuzzy topic
* What are individuals’ concerns re: privacy?
  * Pew Research Ctr did a study that touches on this (link added above)
  * Public is concerned about privacy/security, but they don’t have choice/agency
* What is “good”? Need an ethical basis
* Privacy and Security aren’t really the same thing
  * Ex: Link NYC (free wifi spots around the city). This is a privacy concern bc it could facilitate the tracking of individuals as they pass between wifi spots. This is a security concern bc individuals are now using non secure wifi connections.
  * 2-factor ID systems: enhance security of system, but forces participants to share phone number.
* Let’s assume you can opt in to a system. Once you’re in, opting out isn’t always a possibility.
  * Autonomy issues. Can’t change choice.
* Increase in privacy could lead to an increase in security
* Should come up with clear terms / definitions (list of terms above)
   * Key Terms
     * Privacy
     * Security
     * Anonymity
     * Consent
     * "Choice" - This is something that the GDPR goes into substantial detail about, which seems useful (they actually use it to define consent that is "freely given").

* Should create a catalog of horror stories (ex: Equifax) and how to avoid.
   * Both Abstract and actionable
     * Ex- actionable can also be flexible for the current technology. In finance- saying ‘you should diversify your portfolio’ is vague enough that the best investments of the time can be applied to it
   * Target Outputs
     * Core “Eternal” principles of privacy and ethics
       * Written draft on github?
     * Case studies of things to avoid doing
       * Put together “horror story” case studies
         * Equifax
     * Pointers to canonical resources that can help you do things right
       * NSF Data management plan template
       * Bibliography of important papers/arguments
* Look at privacy/confidentiality reviews for research
   * Need to know where data are, who has access to them
* How will we ID dependencies across working groups? What is the process?

4. In our next meeting, we will discuss the following questions. Please reflect on how you might answer the following / what other questions they raise:

   * “To what extent do data scientists have a responsibility to ensure that the data they work with is collected, stored, and distributed in a safe and ethical way? What can data scientists commit to doing, in order to promote this?”
