Notes

- Our group needs to gather our thoughts for a presentation that the larger D4D group is making in February.
    - Need to set a deadline for this.
- Margeaux will add some info to the Google Doc to help us build out our presentation asynchronously.
- Joshua may be able to attend the meeting on February 6th.
- Margeaux will send out the info about the meeting in Feb to the group.
- Slide 3 from the original presentation could be the intro/overview of the Google Doc
- Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the presentation doc! Please go right ahead! 
- Questions to answer:
    - How do we go about making the Code of Ethics more inclusive, or inclusively-generated? We don’t want just data scientists involved in writing the code.
    - How might we involve domain experts - legal, government, etc.?
- While many of us involved in this effort are not data scientists, we are stakeholders in the field of data science.
- The diversity portion of the CoE should not just be about making the DS Community more inclusive and accessible, but also about ensuring the DS Community appreciates the impact of it’s work on others.
- Note the distinction between DS Community and DS Profession.
- The Code of Ethics should broadly include/apply, regardless of whether people are formal “data scientists” or not, because we’d want everyone to realize that the Code of Ethics applies to them - even if they aren’t an official Data Scientist by profession.
- The Data Science Community is a broad group, of which one subset is Data Science Professionals. The Data Science Community is inclusive of those who feel they are part of it, regardless of how much time we spend doing data science professionally. 
- Two directions on the community aspect:
    - Thought Diversity within the Data Science Community itself
    - Thought Diversity achieved by intentionally reaching outside of the Data Science Community for feedback and collaboration.
- Margeaux will send out a poll for the next meeting
- Everyone should go contribute to the Google Doc - go! Write! Do it!
